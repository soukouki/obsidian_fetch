# ObsidianFetch

MCP servers focused on fetching and presenting information from Obsidian vaults.

The existing MCP server has the following drawbacks:
- It supports many commands, which can cause slow prompt loading when computational resources are limited.
- When reading a note labeled "LLM", it is necessary to search for its path first before loading it, but the LLM may not always follow this procedure.
- Some tools include unnecessary options, leading the LLM to sometimes fail to invoke them correctly.

These issues become particularly noticeable when running an LLM on a local GPU.  
To address this, we developed a new MCP server that simply retrieves and loads lists of notes.

The new server also provides the following additional features:
- When the LLM attempts to retrieve link information by searching with brackets like `[[link name]]`, the server automatically removes any characters that cannot be used in links.
- In addition to loading the note contents, it also displays backlinksâ€”notes that link to the currently opened note.
	- This allows the LLM to load and understand the connections between related notes via backlinks.
